########################### Build CLI (bcli)
```
A Command Line Interface for Build Teams

# What is Buckley? 
Buckley is an opinionated CLI tool made to help Build Teams with rapid development. 
It automates the provisioning of workstations with a set of tools and configurations to minimize time spent onboarding new team members and share good practices via tooling. 

# Installation
## Contributors

If you're trying to develop buckley (🙏) simply clone this repo and from the repo root, run:   
`$ npm install -g .`

## Users
If you just want to use buckley, make sure you have node installed, then run:  

```$ npm install -g buckley```

Once Buckley is installed, you can run `bcli` for a list of available commands.

# Features
## Workstation Setup (`bcli install`)
Buckley has a library of useful tools and packages that can be easily installed on your workstation via the command line.
For help with commands, run `bcli install --help`

### Usage
For a list of available packages run `bcli install --list`

To install all available packages, run `bcli install --all`

### Tags
Packages are organized by tags. To install all recommended packages, run `bcli install --tags recommended`

Tags can be combined for various purposes. E.g. If you're going to be doing full-stack development on an cloud-based project, you can do `bcli install --tags frontend,devops,cloud` to install relevant tools.

Teams can opt to bundle all of their packages under a tag. For example, if you're a developer on the Avalon team,you can install all the packages needed for development on that project by running `bcli install --tags avalon`

## Contributing
The CLI is built using Node.js. There is a large variety of powerful tools available for building CLIs in Node.js, and JS skills tend to be more ubiquitous on most teams than bash skills. Even if you're particularly good at bash scripting, you'll find that it's a lot easier to do things in JS that would otherwise be quite painful to accomplish in bash. 

This project, like most, is a perpetual work-in-progress and is intended to be maintained by the collective Build community. 
Please feel free to make enhancements and improvements as you see fit, and merge directly to master (for now).
